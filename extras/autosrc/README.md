The files in this directory serve to automatically update generate source code for various purposes. 
MakeBasicTypes.py	makes some files in the src/mapgd\_N/datatypes/ directory that handle formating.
MakeSimpleTypes.py	makes some files in the src/mapgd\_N/datatypes/ directory that handle formating.

MakeNewtonRho.py  	may someday make a file to optimize population structure estimates.
MakeNewtonTheta.py	makes a file to optimize genotypic frequencies and error rate estiamtes.
MakeBordyenTheta.py 	may someday do the same thing as newton, but different.
