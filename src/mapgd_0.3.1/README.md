<h3> Introduction </h3>

MAPGD is a series of related programs that estimate allele frequency, heterozygosity, Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and identity by descent (IBD) coefficients from population genomic data using statistically rigorous maximum likelihood approach. 

We have tried to produce an extensible program ...

Ultimately the genetic structure of a population is fully specified by the genotypes of the individuals that compose that popualtion. This means that if we can accurately calculate all [genotypic probabilities](https://lynchlab.github.io/MAPGD/), then the calculation of any other population statistics becomes trivial. The three big stumbling blocks to the calculation of genotypic probabilities are the errors made by the machine when sequencing, failure to sample all parental chromosomes in organisms that are not haploid, and systematic errors ...
