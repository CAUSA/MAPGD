<h3> Introduction </h3>

MAPGD is a series of related programs that estimate allele frequency, heterozygosity, Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and identity by descent (IBD) coefficients from population genomic data using statistically rigorous maximum likelihood approach. It is primarily useful for the analysis of low coverage population genomic data, and provides minimum MSE estimators of these statistics on low coverage sequence. Although other tools, such as vcftools, give similar allele frequency estimates with less computational investment when coverage is high, MAPGD should always be preferred to other programs when calculating IBD coefficients.
