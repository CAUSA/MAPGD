\subsubsection*{Introduction }

M\-A\-P\-G\-D is a series of related programs that estimate allele frequency, heterozygosity, Hardy-\/\-Weinberg disequilibrium and identity by descent (I\-B\-D) coefficients from population genomic data using statistically rigorous maximum likelihood approach. It is primarily useful for the analysis of low coverage population genomic data, and provides minimum M\-S\-E estimators of these statistics on low coverage sequence. Although other tools, such as vcftools, give similar allele frequency estimates with less computational investment when coverage is high, M\-A\-P\-G\-D should always be preferred to other programs when calculating I\-B\-D coefficients.
