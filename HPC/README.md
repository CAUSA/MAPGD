High performance computation support is not yet implemented. A script (split.py) has been included to split an input file into equal size smaller files. mapgd can then be run on these smaller files, and the script (join.py) can be run to join these files once computation is complete. mapgd supports mutlithreaded through OMP, so should make modestly good use of each node. I am working diligently toimplement support for MPS as possible. Although CUDA will likely give significant performance boost, it is not currently a priority.
