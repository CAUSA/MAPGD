High performance computation support is not yet implemented. A script (split.sh) has been included to split an input file into equal size smaller files. mapgd can then be run on these smaller files, and the script (join.sh) can be run to join these files once computation is complete. However, mapgd is currently not mutlithreaded, so it will make very poor use of your computers resources. I am working diligently to correct this as soon as possible.
